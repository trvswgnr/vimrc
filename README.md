# my vim config

this is my simple vim config. like all vim configs, it is a work in progress.

you might be asking yourself, "why are you using vim and not neovim?"

first of all, i love neovim and i will undoubtedly be switching back to it at some point. but for now, i'm using regular ol' vim because i've been using it for years and i'm still not good at it. in an effort to improve and really understand my editor, i'm going to strip away all the bells and whistles that i've been using as a crutch and force myself to learn the basics.

second of all, i'm a masochist.

## installation

1. clone this repo into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/trvswgnr/vimrc.git ~/.vim
    ```

2. start vim (it will install plugins automatically):
    ```bash
    vim
    ```

3. ???

4. profit
